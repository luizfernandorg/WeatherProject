# Weather Project
The objective is to demonstrate how to consume an API,
manipulating JSON received from the https://api.openweathermap.org/,
was used in this project:
- Jquery (https://jquery.com/) : used to call the personal API requesting a JSON response with personalized data
- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/): Used ExpressJS (https://expressjs.com/) and HTTPS to get the data from the API
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SCSS

The code is using a fake token, to preserve the real one, so you need to create a free account on https://openweathermap.org and with the token in your possession you need to set the token on '/getTemperature' on app.js

after you set it up the token edit the HTML file to remove the 'em' tag line
